• Did you do Part 1?

Yes


• Where are the abstract elements based on the formal model of adversarial search
defined?

The class State is the abstract element representing the state and containing the Actions and Transition Model.


• Where are the specific implementations of those elements for Checkers defined?

The state is defined in the state class.  The initial state is a state that is first defined in the file Initialize.
The function for determining terminal state is in the file State. The applicability function is called get_possible_actions()
and it is also in the class state. This function returns a queue containing the Resulting state of each possible action.
The utility function is also in the state class.


• Where is your implementation of the MINIMAX algorithm?

In the file MoveMaker


• What class or file do we run to run your 4x4 game?

MainGame


• Does it play quickly and perfectly?

Yes


• Did you do part 2?

Yes


• Where can we find your implementation of H-Minimax?

In the file MoveMaker


• Where can we find the definition of your heuristic function?

In the file MoveMaker called eval()


• Where can we find your implementation of alpha-beta pruning?

Inside the H-Minimax function


• What class or file do we run to run your 8x8 game?

MainGame


• Comment very briefly on how well it plays

I am not very good at checkers, but it has consistently beat me and one of my friends.  If the cutoff is a depth of 6,
it will answer in <15s, a depth of 7 will answer in <30s, and a depth of 8 will answer in <90s


• Python programmers: Did you use good object-oriented design, with classes, avoiding global functions and variables,
and doing very little outside of any method or function?

Yes
